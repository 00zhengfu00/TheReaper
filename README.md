The Reaper
=======

The Reaper is a iOS game jam during the **Global game jam** at Bordeaux, in the EPITECH School (7-8 november 2014).
The challenge of the **game jam**, is to make a game during 48hours, on on a given topic, and with the technology of our choice. For build this game, we use **SpriteKit** for **iOS 8**, using **Switf**.
