The Reaper is an iOS game during the **Global game jam** at Bordeaux, in the EPITECH School (7-8 november 2014).
The challenge of the **game jam**, is to make a game during 48hours, on on a given topic, and with the technology of our choice. For build this game, we use **SpriteKit** for **iOS 8**, using **Switf**. We our passionate about the mobile development, that's why we choose this technologie.

<h3 align="center">The Goal</h3>
**The Reaper** is a runner, in a scary environment. The goal is, running and as far as possible without getting caught by the monsters. You can put obstacles in the way of watches (Green in the game). But be carefull to the red obstacles, they slow you down.
